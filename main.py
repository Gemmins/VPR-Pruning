# 1. Train networks from scratch on a dataset
# 2. Perform pruning and fine-tuning of a trained network
# 3. Evaluate performance metrics of a network and generate relevant figures

# Should be able to do all three in one command for any specified network architecture
# Also be able to do just two and three together with a directory of models or just a single model
# Able to do just 3 "
# Able to do just 1

# would generally like to abstract? the process of training, pruning and evaluating
# have some simple api that allows easy addition of methods for all three
# providing they return correct types etc.
